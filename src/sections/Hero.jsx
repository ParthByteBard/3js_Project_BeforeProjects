// Overview of the Code:

// Responsive Design Setup:
// The useMediaQuery hook is used to detect the screen size (small, mobile, tablet), and based on this, the calculateSizes function dynamically adjusts the positions and scales of the 3D objects.

// 3D Scene Rendering:
// The Canvas component from @react-three/fiber serves as the main container where all 3D models and animations are rendered.
// Suspense is used to display a fallback (loading screen) while 3D models and textures are being fetched. The CanvasLoader component is rendered during this loading phase.
// Leva is included as a hidden control panel for tweaking 3D variables but is not visible to the user.
// A PerspectiveCamera is set up to provide a 3D view, ensuring the user gets a natural perspective.
// 3D Models and Animations:

// Multiple 3D components like Target, ReactLogo, Rings, and Cube are rendered inside a group. Their positions and scales are adjusted based on the screen size (sizes object).
// The isMobile prop is passed to some components, like Target and Cube, allowing them to adjust behavior depending on the screen size.
// Lighting:

// Basic lighting is added to the scene, including an ambientLight for overall soft light and a directionalLight for sharper, directional illumination.
// UI Components:

// There is text in the hero section introducing "Parth" with a tagline.
// A button at the bottom allows users to navigate to the contact section for collaboration. This button is responsive, with different sizes for mobile and larger screens.
// Positioning and Layout:

// The entire section is styled to take up the full viewport height and width. Various elements are positioned absolutely within this layout, making it responsive and ensuring the 3D scene fills the screen.
// Purpose:
// The Hero section is a visually rich introduction to a portfolio or personal webpage. It combines responsive 3D animations with informative text, creating an engaging user experience.
// The section adjusts its layout and 3D object properties based on the user's screen size, ensuring optimal display across devices.
